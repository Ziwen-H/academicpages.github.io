I'm a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science.

My research focuses on interfacial fluid phenomena including liquid-solid, liquid-liquid multiphase flows as well as the effect of rheology involved.

I enjoyed hiking and exploring the food nearby!
