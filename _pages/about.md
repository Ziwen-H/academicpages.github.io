# 👨‍🎓 About me
* I'm a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. My research focuses on interfacial fluid phenomena including liquid-solid, liquid-liquid multiphase flows as well as the effect of rheology involved. For now, I am working on the collapse of an alveolar-sized bubble using a customized microtensiometer, aiming to understand the role of interfacial rheology in the adsorption of lung surfactants onto a monolayer. Out of research, I enjoyed hiking and exploring the food nearby!

  <em>Figure: A schematic of the combined RIM-TIRM technique and the droplet impact setup (not to scale). The side-view impact was captured using a 150-W AmScope fiber optic light or a Phlox light emitting diode (LED) panel and the bottom views (RIM and TIRM) were illuminated by collimated LED with a wavelength of 625 nm. (b) Snapshots of dimple collapse from RIM and TIRM highlighted by the red dashed circle. Droplet deformation (top row) and the corresponding evolution of the air layer morphologies captured by TIRM (middle row) and RIM (bottom row) for (c) G/W 78 wt. %, (d) XG 250 ppm, and (e) Boger droplets at We ≈ 5, where the time is normalized by the inertio-capillary timescale. The scale bar represents 0.5 mm. Multimedia available online.</em>
