# 👨‍🎓 About me
* I'm a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. My research focuses on interfacial fluid phenomena including liquid-solid, liquid-liquid multiphase flows as well as the effect of rheology involved. For now, I am working on the collapse of an alveolar-sized bubble using a customized microtensiometer, aiming to understand the role of interfacial rheology in the adsorption of lung surfactants onto a monolayer. Out of research, I enjoyed hiking and exploring the food nearby!

* This work characterzied radially-formed microbubble entrainment induced by water droplets impacting an immiscible thin oil film at different impact heights and inclinations. We first identified a large-area microbublles (LAMs) which was later attributed to visco-capillary contact line dynamics. Multiple microbubble trains were observed by introducing surface inclinaion. LAMs was gradually diminished with increasing inertia, so we are able to determine an optimum for maximum entrainment area experimentally which is important for applications such as spray coating/cooling and agricultural applications. Future numerical modeling could provide valubable insights into the underlying instability mechanisms.

* This study “Capillary wave-assisted collapse of non-Newtonian droplets” investigates how capillary waves—surface-tension-driven ripples—govern the collapse dynamics of impacting non-Newtonian droplets. By comparing Newtonian, shear-thinning, and Boger fluids, the authors show that despite the biaxial extensional nature of the deformation, it is the infinite-shear viscosity that primarily controls capillary-wave formation and propagation across all fluid types. Crucially, they demonstrate that the evolution of these waves can be used to pinpoint key rheological transition points, including the polymer overlap (c⁎) and entanglement (c^⁎⁎) concentrations, providing a dynamic, non-intrusive method for characterizing complex fluids with implications for applications such as printing, coating, and spraying.
