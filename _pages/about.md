:bowtie: I'm a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science.

:mag_right: My research focuses on interfacial fluid phenomena including liquid-solid, liquid-liquid multiphase flows as well as the effect of rheology involved. For now, I am working on the collapse of a alveolar-sized bubble using a customized microtensiometer, aiming to understand the role of interfacial rheology in the adsorption of lung surfactants onto a monalayer.

:walking: Out of research, I enjoyed hiking and exploring the food nearby!
